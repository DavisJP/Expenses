# Expense Splitter App
First Android App. It's a refactored version of a project I did in Dec/2013 for a Mobile Development course at University of Technology, Sydney. 
Users should be able to divide their bills save, retrieve and share their expenses from the app.

As time has passed and I had a lot going on, this became more of a pet project that I always go back to try new things and maybe contribute to the community.
